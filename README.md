# Todo-List-App
Todo List App using HTML CSS And JavaScript

In this To Do list app we can add our personal and business tasks and mark them as completed or incomplete. We can write the new task in the input box, select whether itâ€™s personal or business and click on the "Add" button then the new task will be added to the list. We can click on the task name to mark it as completed or incomplete task. We also have two close icons edit/delete to edit or delete a particular task from the Todo list. 

In this JavaScript Project we are using Local Storage that will store the task list or Todo list in our web browser, so if we close or restart the browser the Todo list will be saved and displayed.
